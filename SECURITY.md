# Security Policy

CROVIA is built around **trust, transparency, and evidence integrity**.  
To preserve these guarantees, all security concerns must be handled carefully,
confidentially, and promptly.

---

## 1. Supported Versions

Security reports apply to the **latest main branch** and any tagged releases
explicitly marked as stable.

---

## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover:

- a weakness in trust/payout computation  
- issues in hash-chain or SHA-256 verification  
- potential bypasses of validation logic  
- data integrity problems  
- documentation errors that may mislead auditors  

please report it immediately via:

📧 **security@croviatrust.com**

Provide:

- a clear description of the issue  
- steps to reproduce  
- expected vs. actual behavior  
- potential impact  
- suggested fixes (optional)

---

## 3. Disclosure Process

1. We acknowledge your report within **72 hours**  
2. We investigate internally  
3. A fix is developed and reviewed  
4. We coordinate a responsible disclosure  
5. Security updates are documented transparently

We do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix is available.

---

## 4. Scope

Do report:

- integrity or validation bugs  
- hash-chain issues  
- payout miscalculations  
- trust metric inconsistencies  
- documentation misleading enough to cause operational errors  

Do NOT report:

- issues in private, closed-source components (not part of this repo)  
- non-security bugs (open an Issue instead)

---

## 5. Philosophy

Security in CROVIA is not secrecy.

It is **verifiable correctness**.

Your help strengthens that foundation.
