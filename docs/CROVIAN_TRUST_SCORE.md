# CROVIAN TRUST SCORE + TRANSPARENCY INDEX — Concept (Open-safe)

The industry has:
- policies
- checklists
- PDF compliance

But it lacks a **unit of measure**.

Crovia introduces:

- **Crovian Trust Score (0–100)** — a single adoption-friendly number
- **Transparency Index** — the public-facing subset of the score

> “What’s your Crovian Score?”

## What the Score Represents

The score is not marketing.
It is a compression of evidence quality into one number, derived from:

- license clarity (declared / verifiable / unknown)
- provenance completeness (providers, shards, traceability)
- receipt integrity (schema validity, share_sum health, rank sanity)
- dispersion & concentration (provider distribution)
- bundle completeness (hashchain, signature, assumptions)
- disclosure readiness (AI Act style gaps pack)

Open-core can compute the “structural” components.
PRO may add semantic and risk layers.

## Transparency Index (public subset)

Transparency Index is designed to be safely public.

It should be derivable from:
- receipts + validation reports
- compliance packs
- trust bundle metadata
- hashchain + signature presence

No raw dataset required.

## Why It Matters

A single number becomes a forcing function:

- procurement can compare vendors
- regulators can benchmark disclosures
- labs can track improvement over time

Crovia makes “trust” measurable.

This document is open-safe.
Exact weights and advanced semantics may exist in PRO.
